# Python-Bouncing-DVD-Logo-Demo
A simple Python application that mimics the classic Bouncing DVD Logo idle computer screen, but utilizing shapes instead of the actual logo.

## How to run it on your own machine
There are two options to run the program on your machine:

### For those who have Python installed
1. Install the Pygame library
```bash
pip install pygame
```

2. Run the app
```bash
python main.py
```

### For those who do not have Python installed or do not want to install any dependencies
Run the app using the following command:
```bash
./main.exe
```

If the above command doesn't work, use the below one instead:
```bash
.\main.exe
```

Please note that which version you use depends on the OS you are using (i.e Windows, MacOS, Linux).
